# Random Datasets

I often find cool collection of information that might come out to be useful for some people. Thought why not keep them in a repository here on github? 

I'll try to credit the origin of each of the files as much as I can as I may sometimes find some files around the internet with no information about the creator/ sources. 
If you feel like any of file is from you / some one you know , please feel free to contact me, I'll add a credit right away.
